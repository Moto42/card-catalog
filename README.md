# card-catalog
Eventualy this is planned to be an easy-to-use cataloging program for your personal library.

The server will present a RESTful api allowing frontend programs to add/remove books, storage locations, users; and checkout books, see a full chekcout history of the books.

Just all the stuff I've wanted to do and or keep track of in my personal library.

Also planned is a default frontend available as a single page application, served up by GETing the index.
